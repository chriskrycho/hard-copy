| To grow older is not to fade
|         unless you make it so---
|     rather, to ripen slowly into wisdom
|         as like an aging tree.
| So let me dig deep in life's passing
|         with roots down by still streams,
|     until I someday stand, hoary and kind,
|         like an oak in winter.
