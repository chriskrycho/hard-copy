Summary: Link&mdash;my review of Jerram Barrs' Echoes of Eden at Mere Orthodoxy.
...

This is sort of a [hybrid review and essay][review]. The review proper concludes:

> In short, Echoes of Eden says all the right things. Barrs has provided a
> healthy, sound theology of the arts, reiterating and synthesizing the helpful
> work of Schaeffer, Lewis, Tolkien, O’Connor, and Dostoevsky. What is more, his
> survey of English literature grounds that theology in concrete examples we can
> follow. This is a solid book.

But there was a bit more to say about this, because...

> There was one thing it lacked, though: beauty of its own. As Barrs himself
> says, “A book that is not well-written, no matter how compelling the story is,
> will not be reread multiple times” (114). I doubt I will read Echoes of Eden
> again, because this is true for non-fiction as well. Form matters. It may not
> be quite true that the way we say things is just as important as what we
> say—better to say the truth boringly than a lie splendidly—but it comes a
> close second. The truth is beautiful, and we should always aim to present it
> beautifully.

I think you'll find the rest interesting! [Take a look.][review]

A note: I actually meant to have this reviewed about 18 months ago. I got buried
in Greek III and it totally slipped my mind! Gladly, the folks at Crossway who
sent me the book were understanding.
