> Poetry, as I have been arguing throughout this study, is not just a set of

> a particular way of imagining the world---particular in the double sense that
> poetry as such has its own logic, its own ways of making connections and
> engendering implications, and because each system of poetry has certain
> distinctive semantic thrusts that follow the momentum of its formal
> dispositions and habits of expression.
