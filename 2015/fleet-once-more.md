| Every time I step out to take a run,
|     it seems the clouds roll back,
|     the sun begins to shine,
|     intensifies its radiance and heat.
| This makes for great discomfort, toil,
|     as sweat rolls down my brow
|     and heart rate climbs too quick,
|     requires me to slow and sweat the more.
| It frustrates, irritates, annoys me,
|     that though I wish to speed,
|     to cruise along, to glide,
|     but quickly---not clodding in the heat.
| Even so, I step out the door again:
|     someday cooler airs, or cloudy skies,
|     or both will come, and gladly
|     I will find my feet are fleet once more.
