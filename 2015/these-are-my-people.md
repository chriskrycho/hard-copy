Title: These Are My People

Summary: >
    When I went to Seattle for BibleTech 2015, I expected to put a nice mark on
    my résumé and learn some interesting things. I came out with something much,
    much more valuable.

At the end of April, I flew out to Seattle to [give a talk][talk] at
[BibleTech], a conference hosted by Faithlife (the company that owns Logos Bible
Software). What I found was not only a bunch of interesting content---though
there was certainly plenty of that, and props to the Logos/Faithlife people for
putting on a great event---but also an awful lot of people *a lot like me*.

Those of you who know me well know this is rare. Finding people who share *one*
of my primary interests *and approach it the same way I do* is relatively rare.
Finding people who share an interest is not especially hard, but that
qualification is extraordinarily important: I know lots of people interested in
programming, and lots of people interested in theology, and not many at all who
approach either the same way I do. Finding people who are interested in both
software *and* theology (still less also music and linguistics and so on) has
been so rare as to be a point of quiet but significant and ongoing frustration
in my life.

And then I went to BibleTech, and met a lot of amazing people.

I was reflecting on the experience today---thinking about why I've so deeply
enjoyed not only the conference itself but [the community][slack] that has
sprung out of it---I realized: *These are my people.* They share a passion for
software development, theology, linguistics, and in many cases even music. There
may not be many of us in the world, but a substantial number were assembled in
Seattle April 30--May 1, 2015. That's no small thing.

I have no idea what the future holds for me---whether it will continue to 
include writing software for the Bible specifically or not---but I *can* say
that this phase of my life has been enormously beneficial in this one way if in
no others. It is nice to find kindred spirits in the world, and to know that,
even if I am pretty strange, there are other strange people out there, too, and
that we can keep working in our strange ways to make the Word of God more 
available and more useful to people every day.

Good work, BibleTech.
