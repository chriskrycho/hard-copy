_Jesus and the Victory of God: Christian Origins and the Question of God, Volume
Two_, by N. T. Wright, Minneapolis: Fortress, 1996, 741 pages. Reviewed by
Christopher Krycho.


Introduction
------------

Few books can claim to represent a substantive entry in both apologetics and
hermeneutics, yet this is precisely what N. T. Wright's _Jesus and the Victory
of God_ accomplishes. In this book, the second in Wright's massive work on
Christians origins,[^1] he treats the question of the historical Jesus via a
thorough survey of the modern history of interpretation and the contents of the
synoptic gospels themselves. The result is a telling well within historic
Christian orthodoxy, though often at sharp angles to current historical
approaches to Jesus. Along the way, he also marks out a fruitful interpretive
path for Christians reading the gospels. The picture he paints of Jesus---a
first-century prophet-Messiah who saw himself standing at the capstone of
Israel's history, fulfilling Yahweh's plans for his people, but in a way no one
in his day seemed to expect---is both apologetically compelling and spiritually
illuminating.


Overview
--------

Wright begins with an introduction designed to orient the reader to the basic
challenges confronting any would-be interpreter of Jesus in the modern era.
Critical issues abound, and it is impossible to return to a pre-critical reading
of the text. But though the historian must deal with any number of problems in
interpreting the person of Jesus, these problems are not specific to him; they
are endemic to the task of history.

Wright therefore begins by establishing his criteria for evaluating
interpretations of Jesus' person and program. Any such theory must account for
the transition from Judaism to Christianity; it must therefore present Jesus,
the lynchpin of that transformation, as not only *dissimilar* to both
worldviews, but also *similar* to both (132). Jesus must have made sense to his
Jewish contemporaries, but also profoundly theologically innovative, to create
an entirely new community with its own theology and practice. Wright argues
Jesus accomplished this via a program in which "\[the\] symbolic world of
first-century Judaism has been rethought from top to bottom, even while its
underlying theology (monotheism, election, and eschatology) has been retained"
(218)---with Jesus himself at the center of the plan of Israel's god, uniquely
embodying a father-son relationship with
<span class="divine-name tetragrammaton">YHWH</span>.

He argues this thesis in two major parts, one focusing on the work and teachings
of Jesus as a messianic prophet, the other focusing on the Jesus' aims and
beliefs as he carried out his program. Along the way, Wright examines a wide and
representative sample of Jesus' reported deeds and teachings. In each case, the
data fits the thesis: Jesus was retelling Israel's story in a new way, with
himself at the center of God's plan to end his people's long exile. By the end
of the volume, Wright can thus conclude:

> \[Jesus\] believed himself called, by Israel's god, to *evoke* the traditions
> which promised <span class="divine-name tetragrammaton">YHWH</span>'s return
> to Zion, and the somewhat more nebulous but still important traditions which
> spoke of a human figure sharing the divine throne; to *enact* those traditions
> in his own journey to Jerusalem, his messianic act in the Temple, and his
> death at the hands of the pagans (in the hope of subsequent vindication); and
> thereby to *embody* <span class="divine-name tetragrammaton">YHWH</span>'s
> return. (651)

This is not a simple restatement of typical Christian belief, though of course
it accords with it. It goes further, making sense of Jesus' words and deeds in a
way that meets Wright's criterion of double dissimilarity and double similarity.
The thesis passes the test.


Assessment
----------

Wright's volume has much to commend it: its historical method, its thoroughness,
its broad engagement with opposing views, even its style. Its most significant
contributions, though, fall under two basic headings: a challenge to many modern
(atheological or even anti-theological) re-readings of the gospels, and a
challenge to many current evangelical interpretation of the gospels. Both of
these are successful in large measure because of Wright's care (and flare) in
dealing with the material and with other (contrary) treatments of the same data,
but it is Wright's ability to build cogent arguments with that material on this
scale which makes this more than a tedious summary of data.

Against secular, demythologizing, and materialist interpretations of the text,
Wright mounts a serious and substantive case for a traditional (though not
uncritical) assessment of the historical reliability of the synoptics and their
picture of Jesus. Many critics suppose that the picture of Jesus painted by the
gospellers must be anachronistic, ideologically-driven or
situationally-motivated, or inflated by faith in contradistinction to history.
Such readings of Jesus paint him as any variety of figures: a sadly-mistaken
apocalyptic prophet; a Stoic philosopher in first century garb; a preacher of
progressive ideas of love and tolerance; the author of a new, non-Jewish
religion; a preacher of Jewish (or timeless) verities. One suspects, with
Wright, that many of these readings find their source not in the text but in the
prejudices or preferences of the commentators. Wright's argument, by contrast,
is far more credible than any of these---and not simply because it aligns with
the historic confession of Jesus as Messiah and Lord. Rather, his picture of a
distinctly Jewish apocalyptic prophet makes the best sense of the actual
evidence from the earliest texts, including not only the synoptic gospels but
also the early epistles and even the non-canonical literature like the Gospel of
Thomas.

The second major value of the book is its (usually, but not always, quiet)
challenge to many *Christian* readings of the gospels. Wright accurately notes
that many Christian interpreters, perhaps especially in the Protestant
tradition, have struggled to make sense of the gospels. Many evangelical
readings of the gospels find little or no connection between what Jesus said and
did and his crucifixion and resurrection. Indeed, no few of the commentaries
this author has read sturggle to make much of the Pharisees' and Sadducees'
mutual hostility toward Jesus without reducing them to caricatures, or to make
sense of many of the parables or their role in Jesus' ministry. The
interpretation Wright proposes accounts for all these issues, and provides a
helpful hermeneutic for untangling many of the otherwise perplexing passages in
the gospels.

Wright's work thus walks a helpful middle ground between misinterpretations on
either side. Anachronistic tendencies among both secular and Christians
interpreters lead both astray. He was not a modern progressive, nor an
unfortunately mistaken apocalyptic street preacher, nor a teller of timeless
ethical truths, nor a preacher of a new religion of grace oddly disconnected
from Judaism. Rather, he was a Jewish prophet going about the business of
offering a subversive interpretation---though one deeply in touch with the Law
and Prophets---of <span class="divine-name tetragrammaton">YHWH</span>'s
promises to his. This is unsurprising. After all, this is precisely how the
gospels present Jesus: dissimilar in certain ways from both the Judaism that
preceded him and the Christianity that followed him (again: Wright's criteria of
double dissimilarity). Any telling of the historical Jesus must provide an
explanation for the transition from Second Temple Judaism to Christianity, and
do so on historically plausible grounds. So must any right interpretation of the
gospels for Christian piety. Wright's theory accomplishes this handily.

Perhaps even more important is the way in which Wright's work strikes at a kind
of nascent docetism among many Christians. While Jesus' full humanity may be an
article of faith for orthodox believers, many fail to think of what exactly that
means. Jesus was not merely as a divine mystery speaking timeless truths and
then fulfilling a cruciform commission strangely disconnected from his
parable-telling, paralytic-healing ministry. Rather, he was a *man* standing at
the conclusion the line of Jewish men who had called Israel back to faithfulness
and proclaimed that Israel's God was about saving the whole world. Not only does
Wright have a Chalcedonian Christology, he is *more* orthodox than many
believers: the Jesus painted in this portrait is no less human than divine.
Jesus' sense of vocation, his real temptations and struggles to fulfill that
vocation, and even his not-rare, but unconventionally-embodied, claim to
Messiahship were the actions of a first-century Jewish *man*. To see this
clearly is to see exactly what the Fathers meant in their confession of "our
Lord Jesus Christ, the same perfect in Godhead and manhood, truly God and truly
man... consubstantial with us according to the Manhood, in all things like unto
us, without sin..."[^2] To miss it is to risk missing the humanity of Christ in
all its glory.


Application and Conclusion
--------------------------

Wright's work is to be commended on a number of levels. Its scholarly depth
makes it a formidable resource when discussing the historical Jesus,
particularly with those who reject the gospels' claims to present Jesus
accurately. Wright's enjoyable wit makes the length of the work far more
manageable. His proposed hermeneutic, though it can be pressed too far, provides
a helpful tool for interpreting the synoptics. Most of all, his reminder of the
real and true humanity of Jesus is a sharp rejoinder to the functional docetism
all too common in evangelicalism. The book is therefore very helpful for both
apologetics and exegesis. Whatever their other differences with Wright, pastors
and teachers would do well to digest Wright's work here.
