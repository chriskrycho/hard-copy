Over the past few years, we have watched as sexual mores have shifted---rather dramatically---in American culture. We have seen the normalization of homosexuality and the beginnings of the normalization of polyamory, and close behind the first whispers of normalization for incest and pedophilia. Theologically and socially conservative Christians have tried to fight this shift over the few decades, and have (at least for the present) lost the public debate. With the Supreme Court's ruling that same-sex marriage is legally recognized in all fifty states, things feel to many like they have shifted under our feet. Many leaders bemoan the degradation of our culture, and look with a kind of horrified expectancy for legal activism against Christians and others (Orthodox Jews, conservative Muslims, Mormons, and so on) who do not support the new moral order.

Responses to these trends have included no few critiques of the very idea of homosexual attraction on the one hand, and plenty of lambasting of a previous generation's leaders on the other. The older conservatives often aimed to undercut the gay rights movement by claiming that homosexuality, as such, does not exist---that it is merely a choice, and one people can readily opt out of. More, they took it as a point of political debate, and readily slammed people facing homosexual attraction as *especially* sinful. Though this was perhaps understandable in the face of brazen sexual immorality, it missed a few crucial realities, not least the deeply human struggles and needs that even that brazen immorality expressed. Among many younger conservatives, this tone has come to be the fundamental error of the previous generation. Certainly, many younger evangelicals have simply abandoned their parents' conservative stance on this issue---but not *all* have, and those who have not have typically taken aim at the older generations' tone and stance.

Both of these positions are partly right. Older conservatives have been right to decry brazen sexual immorality as fundamentally destructive to culture. Younger conservatives have been right when they have noted that much of the church's response has been holier-than-thou and has mashed hard on people for attractions and temptations they did not choose, and for which they have historically suffered (a theme Ross Douthat [traced out thoroughly and carefully][Douthat] last year as he reflected on this same outcome at lower levels of the court system). As followers of Christ, we ought to be clear and forthright about moral evils, and we do believe that sexual immorality, including the practice of homosexuality, is in that category. However, as followers of Christ we also ought to be deeply sympathetic to the reality that *none* of us choose our struggles or our temptations, and equally to the fact that all of us sin grievously, such that God's own self-sacrifice is necessary on *my* behalf. And we have not threaded this needle well. We have tended either to hammer on "those gays" or on "the judgmental church."

But all of this is really driven by much older problems, and goes much deeper in evangelicalism than these spasms on the surface might suggest. This is not merely a reflection of evangelicalism's tone problem, or only a reflection of the depravity of the world around us (depending on which cohort you ask). Although we have gotten this wrong in both of these ways---and we have, by both capitulating to the world's mores and by responding in profoundly unloving ways to our neighbors---our situation primarily reflects a deeper problem in evangelicalism: a profoundly deficient *theological anthropology*.

Our *theological anthropology* is the way we configure our understanding of what it means to be a human being in light of our creation in the image of God. And there is a lot even to that definition: *human being*, *image of God*, and *creation* all warrant further unpacking, and the relationship between them is neither simple nor unimportant.

*What does it mean to be a human?*

Much of the debate about homosexuality has sprung from different answers to this core question. Maybe that seems overly dramatic, or too simplistic, but the way we think about human nature---the purpose and form of being a person with these bodies, in this reality---impinges on every other question, inevitably and inescapably. To say that every person is made in the image of God is to say many things, but among others it means this: people are not in the end the arbiters of their own existences. We have a shape designed to fit into the puzzle of this world in a certain way. When we decide not to fit *here* but *there*, and in so doing set ourselves up as little puzzle-makers, we inevitably distort and contort ourselves into positions that are incoherent and even absurd. That goes for Christians and non-Christians alike: believing that the Son became incarnate, lived, died, rose, and is seated at the right hand of the Father is enough to be saved, but it is *not* enough to guarantee that we think rightly. Those truths must be applied.

Equally, though: it is *those* truths which must be applied. We may reason in the abstract about humanity with some measure of success. God gave us good minds, and we should use them. But we have from the very beginning put those minds to ill use. We have decided not to determine how to solve *this* puzzle but how to remake the puzzle into one we prefer. Appeals to natural law are good and right, and they might in the mysterious providence of God be used as means of common grace in the life of a people for a time. But for Christians to think rightly about sex, or about art-making, or about ecological ethics, or about parenting, we are going to have to look more closely at the two Adams: at the one who fell, and at the one who rose. Especially at the one who rose.

We have not dwelt deeply enough on this one fact: God became a man. The Incarnation is [not merely a prerequisite][athanasius] for penal substitutionary atonement. It is itself an essential element of our salvation, and it is also one of the keys for understanding human nature rightly. Without it, even if we recognize the Puzzle-maker's plan and want to complete his puzzle, we are trying to make out edges and shapes in a dim light, more by feel than by sight. In the light of Jesus the Messiah's bursting onto the scene, many more things become clear. And a *theological anthropology* becomes possible. We ask, "What does it mean to be a human?" and if our answers are still halting and faltering, we at least have a starting point: the face of God in the life of man, and the life of God in the face of a man.

To be sure, it is [insufficient] to have the right ideas about things. Our cultural context will shape us in surprising and difficult-to-overcome ways as well. However, we must acknowledge our own culpability and agency along the way as well; we are not merely slaves to our circumstances, but active agents who create the technologies with which we so often enslave ourselves. To mix up philosophy and internet-style speak: contingency is a thing.
