| October was a long month, and strange,
|     for how quickly it seemed to end.
| Long days, and many weary of them,
|     yet also more to do than fit.
| And, much the same, so this year has gone,
|     but two months left; the rest behind.
| Life, it seems, is brief; it passes quick,
|     so stewardship of days comes dear.
| Falls' leaves, and spring's, come swift and swifter
|     take heed, with reckoning in mind.
| Live full and well, diligent and glad;
|     count each day and decade---a gift.
