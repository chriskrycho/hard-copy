I would not say [the poem] I posted today is particularly good---but I wrote it,
and that is something. I want to be writing longer-form, narrative poetry, and
this has a *little* more of that than what I have been doing lately. I need to
start using constraining forms (and especially historical forms) once more: that
makes for richer, better poetry from me.

This is significant: we learn how to do certain kinds of creative work (perhaps
all creative work!) by closely following the forms and approaches of those who
preceded us. This is just as true of composing music as of poetry.

An aside: the fact that the final words of the first and third, and second and
fourth stanzas of that poem are the is a total coincidence. There is a greater
degree of serendipity in art---or at least, in my art---than would boost my ego
to let on. But ego-boosting be damned.
