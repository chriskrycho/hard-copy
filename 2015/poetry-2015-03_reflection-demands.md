| Reflection demands
|     of its practitioners, like poetry,
|     like painting, dance, or ev’ry art,
|     pain and toil, labor and sacrifice
|         for—
|     mind, like limb
|     like bow-stroke on a violin, or brush-stroke on a page
|     is weak by nature: dull, dim, faint
|         for—
|     all our faculties, like autumn leaves,
|     like ancien régime, or crumbled-down façade,
|     are fallen, troubled, and woe’d
|         so—
|     loose the mind from surly bond!
|     set intellect free by striving hard!
|     free from ruinous decay, and
|     free from foolish sluggery
|     with ev’ry breath sing higher note
|     by ev’ry step climb further up
|         and—
|     so deliver to the self
|     what wisdom may be found.
