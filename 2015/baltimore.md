When the police beat an 87-year-old grandmother who called 911 to get medical
help for her grandson who had been shot---just because they don't believe
her---and suffer no consequences for it, the "law" as such has become wicked.
This doesn't excuse riots, but it sure as heck *explains* them. Baltimore is
broken, but primarily in a massive system of abuse. Yes, pray for peace. But
remember that civic peace comes in large part through civic *justice*; rule of
law follows the law ruling justly.

Connor Friedersdorf has a lot more; [you need to read it], even though---or
rather, precisely because---it is such a mess.
