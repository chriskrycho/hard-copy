Summary: >
    Link: Andrew J. Camenga took advantage of the fact that my site design is
    under an open-source license, and adapted it. It is truly lovely!
...

I confess: my *first* response to seeing [this page][ac] was a flash of anger:
_Hey, he didn't just learn from my site configuration, he actually stole my site
_**design**_!_ And then I remembered: I open-sourced the design precisely so
people could do that. This was just the first time I've ever actually had
someone reuse something I did and shared like this. It was a strange (but
ultimately wonderful) feeling. I hope to have it again many more times.

In any case, I rather like the tweaks Andrew Comenga made to my design to make
it his own; [go take a look][ac]!
