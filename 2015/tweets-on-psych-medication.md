Yesterday evening, I saw Peter Leithart ([\@PLeithart][leithart]) retweet this
from the [\@\_Theopolis][theo] account:

> Psych meds are a lobotomy in a bottle. -Rich Bledsoe<br/>

[theo]: https://twitter.com/_Theopolis

I responded, because I'm a theologically conservative Christian with a high view
of the value of spiritual work on our psyches, and therefore agree with much of
the *intent* of this critique---but also a Christian with a robust anthropology
(of the sort I would expect Leithart to have!) which undercuts *this* kind of
response.

Perhaps it is simply that I am more attuned to these things because my wife
deals with clinical depression, but in any case this kind of thinking is
*profoundly* destructive, and all-too common in the church.

My response:
