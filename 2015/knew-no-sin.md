This is one of the single most beautiful sentences in the Bible, and it is
*incredible* in the original:

> τὸν μὴ γνόντα ἁμαρτίαν ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν ἁμαρτίαν ἐποίησεν, ἵνα ἡμεῖς γενώμεθα
> δικαιοσύνη θεοῦ ἐν αὐτῷ.

That is:

> He made the one who knew no sin to be sin for us---so that we might become
> God's righteousness in him.
