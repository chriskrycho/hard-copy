<i class="editorial">Jaimie and I are presently trapped in a hotel in New York
City, courtesy of winter weather. We decided to do a little writing challenge!
The rules of our challenge were: we had 30 minutes to write at least 500
words, it had to be fantasy, it had to be about someone the opposite sex of
the author, and it had to be about someone elderly. This is mine.</i>

The door opened, but it did not creak. It *always* creaked. Like Janice's bones
in the morning, it creaked.

She frowned at the back of the door facing her. Someone stood there, it seemed;
a shadow darkened the floor by the doorway. Her eyes were rheumy enough, and
the room layout ridicuous enough, that she couldn't say more.

"Who is it? she called out. Croaked out, more like, but that was the price of
eighty years' of cigarettes.

«Time.» Helpful response, that was.

"What's that?" She was still croaking. She coughed, tried to clear her throat.

«Time,» he said again. She thought it was a he, but his voice sounded funny.
Far away. Then again, her ears had been going for long enough now.

"Time? Kids aren't coming today, so you can have all you want. But who are
you?"

«It. is. time.»

The shadow looked darker. She frowned, pursed her lips, and shook her head.
"Young man---you are young, aren't you? You don't sound old---come in here and
sit down and explain yourself."

«I. sit. for. no. one.»

Janice blinked a few times. She sat back in her chair. She tried to take a deep
breath, coughed, coughed some more, gave up on the deep breath, contented
herself with a swallow instead. That seemed more appropriate anyway. But no, she
was just being absurd. Old, even.

"Well, all right, then, but come in where I can see you."

«No. it. is. your. time.»

She swallowed again.

"Time for what?" Just to be sure. The shadow was still getting darker. It could
have been her eyes, but the rest of the room was the same as before: fuzzed out
to an irritating degree, but bright enough.

«Time. to. depart.»

"Son, or whatever you are" (she no longer thought it was anyone who ought to be
called son, or daughter for that matter) "be clear. I don't have time for
whatever your game is. Had enough of foolishness twenty years ago."

«It. is. time. for. you. to. depart. this. life.»

Well, then. One thing to have a half-cocked notion of a thing like that, but
another hear it from the mouth of... time? itself. "Is it now?" she managed.
"Well, you took long enough getting here. Family's been telling me that for a
good twenty years now."

Where the shadow stood on the floor in front of the door was all dark now.
Shaped something like a man, for all her blurred sight could make out, but black
as a night when all the moons were down.

She was ready, though. Ready as you could be. "Do you announce yourself to
*everyone* like this, or just half-blind old ladies?" She sounded like a
bullfrog with a sore throat.

The shadow answered. «All. those. who. have. time.»

Helpful. Not that it mattered. She *was* ready. She was.

The shadow was suddenly before her. A starless, moonless night. Time indeed.

Janice stood up. Face it on your feet, she'd always said. To the blazes with
that, now, she concluded. Face it asleep in the night was a better plan. But
here she was.

She could still run. Jump a little even. So she did. She threw herself at the
shadow, and as she came to it, she thought she saw stars.

And then everything was gone except the stars, whirling before suddenly clear
eyes. Ten billion galaxies whirled; pulsars flamed and danced in time; suns
flared and planets spun.

Green grass, dusted with snow.

«You. have. time.»

She looked up. Stars, not night.

«Spend. it. well.»

She stood.
