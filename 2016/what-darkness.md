| what darkness crawls on human hearts
| in times between times, in waitings,
| what shadows 'twine and strangle souls
| after hoping's wretched end
| 
| what murks do clamp on human hopes
| in days which be nights, in sorrows
| what gloom does bind and tangle minds
| after dreaming's left undone
| 
| but
| nights end
| and
| night's end
| yet...
