This bit from the [fish][fish] [design document] perfectly captures what git does wrong (emphasis mine):

> When designing a program, one should first think about how to make a intuitive and powerful program. Implementation issues should only be considered once a user interface has been designed.

> Rationale:

> This design rule is different than the others, since it describes how one should go about designing new features, not what the features should be. **The problem with focusing on what can be done, and what is easy to do, is that too much of the implementation is exposed. This means that the user must know a great deal about the underlying system to be able to guess how the shell works, it also means that the language will often be rather low-level.**
