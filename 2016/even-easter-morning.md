| The ways we carry on in this modern world
| do at times perplex me
| for we are not, or not especially,
| mindful of the world around us.
| 
| It is charged, they say, charged with wonder,
| and I suppose it must be
| for this is a world where God became a man,
| and died, and lived again
| 
| But every day seems a day like another,
| even Easter morning
| Because we do still live in the time
| between the times:
| 
| Christ is risen!
|     ---and we still die, and mourn
|         (but not without hope)---
| Christ will come again!
| 
| And this is why we meet
| this is why we sing
| and tell each other again
| the old story, as if new
| 
| So that on gray days like every other
| even Easter morning
| We remember, though still in the time
| between the times:
| 
| Christ is risen!
|     ---and we will live, and dance
|        (when we see our hope)---
| Christ will come again!
