Summary: As she so often does, Ellie simply delighted me tonight, in two wonderful moments&mdash;both of which involved spinning to classical music.

As she so often does, Ellie simply delighted me tonight, in two wonderful moments:

 1. As I was cleaning up the dishes and playing Max Richter's
    [_Memoryhouse_][it] album, I saw Ellie dancing, and encouraged her to keep
    going. After a moment, I looked over to see her spinning in circles. And
    spinning in circles. And spinning in circles. When she finally stopped, she
    started freaking out as she couldn't get her balance. I swooped in and
    picked her up, laughing with her once she recovered.
 2. After she calmed down, she started tugging on my shirt. It took me a few
    seconds to realize what she wanted, but then it clicked: she was trying to
    turn me by twisting my shirt. "You want to spin?" I asked her. She nodded
    vigorously. "Is this a spinning song?" Again, the vigorous nod. So I started
    spinning around and around with her in my arms, and the sheer joy in the
    grin plastered across her face was something to behold. We spun first one
    way, then the other, all the way through ["The Twins (Prague)"][twins].

Moments like these are worth remembering.
