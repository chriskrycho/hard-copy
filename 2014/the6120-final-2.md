Title: Perfectionism
Subtitle: An Imperfect Doctrine Of Sanctification
Summary: The classic Wesleyan doctrine of moral perfectionism in this life is tempting on some fronts&mdash;but profoundly unhelpful.
Template: formats/class

The theory of perfectionism suggests that believers ultimately come to a point
in their *present* walk with God where they stop willfully sinning. This stands
in contrast to non-perfectionistic views which believe the end of willful sin
comes only at *glorification* after one's death.

Modern perfectionism was advocated by John Wesley at some points during his
ministry and adopted as a hallmark of the Wesleyan tradition (though Wesley
himself abandoned the view late in life). In the Wesleyan view, the believer at
some point during his life experiences a "second blessing" in which the Holy
Spirit supernaturally empowers the believer to overcome the rest of his natural
(fleshly) tendency toward sin. This moment must be apprehended by the believer
in faith---it is not guaranteed to all believers but is granted to those who
seek it in faith. The Wesleyans draw this view primarily from the apostle John's
note that "No one who lives in [Christ] keeps on sinning" (1 John 3:6), as well
as from various other passages which suggest that Christians may *stop* sinning.
Moreover, they note the biblical commands to holiness and argue that these
strongly imply (if not demand) that believers be able actually to live truly
holy lives. Thus, believers should pray regularly for this empowering act of the
Spirit in their lives so that they may fulfill God's will that they be truly
holy.

The view has some significant and serious problems, not least in the *rest* of
the book from which they primarily draw their support: John himself notes that
when (not if) believers sin, they have an advocate with the Father in the person
of Jesus himself (1 John 2:1). Similarly, the testimony of Paul and his ongoing
struggles with sin after conversion and his explicit denial of having reached
perfection (cf. Romans 7, Philippians 2) indicates that even for extraordinarily
faithful believers, perfection will remain an unfilled but longed-for state
until death.

Practically, the view readily leads to frustration and even despair on the one
hand or profound hubris on the other. Those who, despite their pleading and
(true!) faith do not have any experience of "second blessing" and instead remain
aware of their ongoing struggle with sin may find themselves thinking they are
simply weak in the faith and that they will never accomplish God's plan for
their holiness. This could not be further from the truth: those most faithfully
walking with God are in fact those *most* aware of their own sinfulness. On the
other hand, those who think they have found this holiness end up self-deceived.
They proclaim their own sinlessness, and prove hypocrites. They may end up
holding themselves up as superior to others (even if only in their own minds).
They certainly will not go on as they ought in the process of mortifying their
own sins, because they are convinced they have none.
