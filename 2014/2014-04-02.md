The confluence of Psalm 69 and 2 Corinthians 4--6 in my reading this morning
highlighted quite profoundly the reality of struggle and pain in the lives of
those who follow Yahweh.[^1] In both cases, the authors deal plainly with the
reality of suffering in their lives, and in both cases, they ultimately turn the
audience's eye away from that suffering to God---not diminishing the suffering,
but putting a terminus on it and giving it clarity.

[^1]: Much of my thinking here is shaped quite actively by Eugene Peterson's
    _Five Smooth Stones for Pastoral Work_, especially the chapter on
    Lamentations. The volume is well worth your time.

In the Psalm, we see David (quite rightly) walking the line we all so often walk
between complaint and praise. He calls out to God for help and deliverance and
points out the unjust nature of their attack on him. He repeatedly points to
God's character and pleads for justice. He calls on God to act in line with his
steadfast love and his mercy (Ps. 69:16), because it was for God that David
suffered. And he praises God for his goodness, even though the structure of the
poem seems to leave David still in his suffering. The conclusion of the psalm is
the turn from "But I am afflicted and in pain; / let your salvation, O God, set
me on high!" (Ps. 69:29) to "I will praise the name of God with a song..." (Ps.
69:30)---not, it seems, because God *had* delivered but because David trusted
that he *would*.

Likewise, in 2 Corinthians Paul repeatedly emphasizes the extent to which
suffering characterized his ministry and indeed dominated his life. These
passages are some of the dearest in the New Testament to believers suffering for
the sake of Christ, because they deal truly and honestly with the pain, but also
deal in hope. God shone light in our hearts, Paul rejoices, but we have his
treasure in earthen vessels that are "afflicted in every way" and which are
"always carrying in the body the death of Jesus" (2 Cor. 4:6,7--12). Paul can
see the purpose of this suffering clearly---it is that the Corinthians and all
the other believers will have the life of Jesus (2 Cor. 4:11)---but this does
not for a moment diminish the reality of the suffering he and his companions
endured. Nor does Paul feel the need to diminish his sufferings in order to
point to God's goodness; quite the contrary, in fact! In chapter 6, he goes on
to describe at length all the *kinds* of suffering he had endured for the sake
of the gospel.

For those who, like David and Paul, hope in Yahweh and seek to do his will,
there will be suffering. Those who preach the gospel will find rejection, pain,
and toil everywhere. Even ordinary believers---those of us less outsized in our
endeavors than the Davids and Pauls of the story---will find in our lives
suffering that pushes us to decide how we will answer. Will we follow David's
example and conclude our lament and our pleading with praise (Ps. 69:30--36)?
Will we follow Paul's example and hold fast to the hope of an "eternal weight of
glory" (2 Cor. 4:17--18) being prepared for us? Will we refuse to diminish the
extent of our suffering but also refuse to let our suffering diminish God? Or
will we take the easy paths out: to make little of the pains of the age on the
one hand (quite dishonestly) or to refuse to praise God because we experience
suffering (blasphemously)?

The call, for all of us, is to look the sufferings of the present age head on,
to recognize them in all their horror, and to call God greater still. Not to
pretend the sufferings are small things, but to see that they are "light and
momentary" (2 Cor. 4:17) by comparison with what God is doing *eternally*. Not
to act as those the situations in our lives do not pain us our trouble us, but
to call God good and to lead others to worship him *anyway*.
