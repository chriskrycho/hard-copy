...

| Come and rest! Come and heal! Ev’ry traitor
|          Ev’ry wretch and stinking fiend: lay down your arms
|     Find comfort here, and respite, rest, rapport
|          All are welcome here, not one refused, none barred
|
| She wearied, wounded, sorrowed, battle-sore
|          Bids her children yet another weary soul embrace
|     Offer care and proffer aid, render service to her foes
|          As—though her progeny—once were as they
|
| Her march to war is ever triumph by defeat
|          Her shields and banners ’blazoned not with martial sign
|     Not lion proud nor weapons bright; instead a bleeding sheep
|          The lamb which piercèd, bruised and bloodied, died
|
| No stranger, prouder heraldry to march beneath
|          But under it she conquers all, so waves she bold
|     The lamb rampant! Dancing proud on trampled death
|          On mort laid low by low-laid, somehow mortal God
|
| Come and rest! she calls— Come and heal! Ev’ry traitor
|          Ev’ry wretch and stinking fiend: lay down your arms
|     Find comfort here, and respite, rest, rapport
|          All are welcome here, not one refused, none barred
|          Beneath the dancing banner: the piercèd, rampant lamb.
