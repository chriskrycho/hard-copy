Summary: Link: My latest piece over at Mere Orthodoxy, on the Incarnation.

My latest piece over at Mere Orthodoxy (and the first such in too long):

> It has been common these past few years to speak of "incarnational theology"
> as a way of describing the Christian mission to the world: we ought to
> "incarnate" Christ to the world as Christ "incarnated" the Godhead to us.
> There is much to appreciate in this sentiment.... Yet for all that, I think
> that applying the language of incarnation to believers is a serious mistake.
>
> The Incarnation matters, and it matters as more than a means of getting Jesus
> to the cross so that he could die for our sins. We evangelicals too often
> reduce everything to penal substitutionary atonement. Yes, the atonement is
> incredible and amazing. It is one of the central affirmations and joys of the
> Christian faith: our sins are paid for! Glory to God! But Jesus did more than
> that, and he is worthy of yet more praise. He did not stop at paying the price
> for our sins while leaving our bodies subject to corruption. He did not
> content himself with performing a judicial act while leaving our wills broken,
> certain to turn again to the same sin that led to our death in the first
> place.

I think [this][link] is the best thing I've written so far this year; I hope you
find it stimulating.
