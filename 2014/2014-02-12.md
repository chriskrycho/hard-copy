Summary: For the authors of Psalm 42, God's salvation remained far off in many ways. For us, God's salvation has come, and we participate in him and partake of him.

Psalm 42 comes in three parts: two statements of woe, and a refrain. It is an
interesting open to the second of five "books" that make up the Psalms, and the
first of the psalms of the sons of Korah. The Psalm includes many of the most
evocative images in the whole book, and many of those we quote most often:

Psalm 42:1:

> | As a deer pants for flowing streams,
> |     so pants my soul fo ryou, O God.

Psalm 42:5 (also 11, which repeeats it):

> | Why are you cast down, O my soul,
> |     and why are you in turmoil within me?
> | Hope in God; for I shall again praise him,
> |     my salvation and my God.

Psalm 42:7:

> | Deep calls to deep
> |     at the roar of your waterfalls;
> | all your breakers and  your waves
> |     have gone over me.

The Psalm is true to life, evocative, and profoundly moving to me. So often we
confront a world in which it seems that all God's waves have gone over us. Yet
the Psalm teaches us both the right response to such circumstances ("Hope in
God; for I shall again praise him") but also about who God is. As I have noted
before, the Psalms are not merely our response to God: they are also his
inspired revelation of himself.

He is the God upon whom we may call in such times. He is the one who "commands
his steadfast love, and at night his song is with [us]" (verse 7).  He is the
God of our lives (verse 7 again). He is the one who alone can quench the thirst
of our souls. It is his presence that will satisfy us, and nothing else. Being
removed from him is death to us, though we often forget it in the callousness of
life in a dead world (verses 1--2). He is the God who made and owns the
waterfalls and the sea and all the lands (verses 6--7). He is the God who calls
his people to go with glad shouts and songs of praise, keeping festival (verse
4). He is the God who knows our tears, even when it seems he does not, for he is
the God who has *shared* our tears.

For the author(s) of this Psalm, God's salvation remained far off in many ways.
For us, God's salvation has come, and we participate in him and partake of him.
It is not only that God has given us salvation; it is that God *is* our
salvation, and for us that salvation has become quite specific. He is Jesus, the
Messiah, the anointed king who does justice and righteousness and peace on the
earth. When the enemies of God's people taunt and say, "Where is your God?"
(verses 3, 10), and when our lives are filled with tears and mourning (verses 3,
9), we know where our God is. He is enthroned; and seated at the right hand of
that throne; and enthroned in our hearts. He is in all and through all and over
all. He is near to us, even in the times when he is silent and seems far away.
 
> | Why are you cast down, O my soul,

> | Hope in God; for I shall again praise him,
> |     my salvation and my God.

Amen.
