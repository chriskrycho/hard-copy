Summary: 

One challenge that we have in deciding how to approach corporate worship is walking the line between emotional manipulation and righty emotional action---especially in our music. It is entirely possible here (as in so many areas) to fall off the cart in a variety of ways.

First, we can recognize the power of music and its effect on our emotions and think that we can thereby cause people to worship, or think that if our emotional response is sufficiently strong that we have entered into true worship.

Second, we can recognize that peril and make sure that our music does *not* stir people's emotions, or simply use music outside the "vernacular" of our culture.

Finally, and in some ways worse than doing either of these on ourpose, we can simply ignore the issue entirely, in which case we will almost certainly fall unto one of these traps without even being aware we are doing so.
