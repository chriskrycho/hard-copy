> The short story is the pastoral form for narrating *Heilsgeschichte*
> (salvation history) in the vocabulary of *Seelsgeschichte* (soul history). In
> the *Heilsgeschichte* of Judges, for instance, the enmity of the Midianiites
> is kerygmatically integrated into the historical narrative and shown to be a
> part of salvation; in the *Seelsgeschichte* of Ruth the bitter emptiness of
> Naomi is pastorally attended to under the dynamics of providence and guided to
> a concluding fullness. In the *Heilsgeschichte* of Exodus the formidable and
> unyielding Egyptians are judged and defeated in the catastrophic plagues and
> miraculous sea crossing; in the *Seelsgeschichte* of Ruth the everday
> ordinariness of gleaning in the barley fields is used as a means for
> accomplishing redemption. In the *Heilsgeschichte* of Joshua the gigantically
> walled fortress Jericho is surrounded and conquered by the total community of
> God in colorful parade, accompanied by brilliantly sounding trumpets, and the
> promised land is entered; in the *Seelsgeschichte* of Ruth an old levirate law
> is patiently and quietly worked through by some old men at the city gates of
> provincial Bethlehem, and a link is forged in the genealogical chain of the
> Messiah.
