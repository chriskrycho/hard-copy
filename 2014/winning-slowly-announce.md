Today, I was happy to be able to finally go public with a project on which I
have been working for the last couple months (and for which I have been planning
since mid-fall): [Winning Slowly][ws]. Winning Slowly is a biweeklypodcast by
yours truly and my good friend [Stephen Carradini][stephen] offering thoughtful
commentary on trends in culture, technology, religion, ethics, and art.

Of possible interest to my readers:

- You can listen to the first episode, [We Need Some Context!][01]
- You can [subscribe to the feed][feed].
- You can follow and get updates via all sorts of social networks:
	* Twitter: [\@winningslowly][twitter]
	* App.net: [\@winningslowly][adn]
    * [App.net broadcast][broadcast] -- notifications on your phone or emails as
      you like
    * [Google+][g+] (yes, shockingly enough)

We're still very much in a "beta" phase. The audio quality needs significant
improvement, our back-and-forth needs to get smoother (and, at times, more back-
and-forth!), and so on. We'd love to hear your feedback. But be gentle.
