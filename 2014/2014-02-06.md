Summary: One of the reasons I sometimes struggle with passages speaking of God's judgment on the wicked is because I do not face persecution or active hostility from those who hate God. I have a lot to learn.

It is apparent to me that one of the reasons I sometimes struggle with passages
speaking of God's judgment on the wicked is because I do not face persecution or
active hostility from those who hate God. I might get called names or insulted
occasionally (though only occasionally), but I have never been at risk of loss
of property, much less of health or life, because I follow Christ. Believers in
other places and other times are not so at ease among those who do not follow
God. For those who are not so at ease, the prosperity and success of those who
oppress them are much larger concerns---much nearer to home, and much more
urgently in need of justice.

Thus, in both of Paul's letters to the Thessalonians, he encourages them to
remain steadfast in part by pointing to God's future judgment on the enemies of
Christ. He points them to the future return of Jesus not to remove the believers
from this world, but to judge those who reject God and to rule in righteousness
over the world. That is a cause for rejoicing for believers: all of us want to
see the world put right, with an end to poverty and war, cancer and rape,
tornadoes and abortion, Alzheimers and murder, oppression and death. Nearly
*everyone* wants this kind of world, in theory. But in practice, we are either
children of God or people who "refused to love the truth and so be saved" (2
Thessalonians 2:10). And those who refuse to love the truth and be saved oppress
and murder the people of God (and everyone else, but *especially* the people of
God).

Our fellow believers in Saudi Arabia and Iran and North Korea are not reading
these passages of judgment and wondering how God could judge so harshly. They
are reading them and holding fast to the hope that this day will come *soon*,
when those who grind underfoot the poor, the widow, and the orphan, who throw
Jesus' followers in jail and execute their pastors, will get justice at the
hands of God. Many of our fellow believers look forward to the day when *they*
will get justice from God, because in this present life injustice has often been
their lot.

> | In just a little while, the wicked will be no more;
> |     though you look carefully at his place, he will not be there.
> | But the meek shall inherit the land
> |     and delight themselves in abundant peace.

This points me forward in several ways. First, it reminds me that this is an
area in which I need to be sanctified. Contrary to everything the surrounding
world says, a lack of judgment on the part of God would be grotesquely
unrighteous. We can see this clearly in the most egregious cases: none of us
think it would be right for Charles Manson or Stalin to get off without
punishment. But God's justice is deeper than ours, and truer, and that is
*good*. Lord willing, I will come to understand more and more the goodness of
his doing justice and righteousness on the earth, not least as I understand that
his *shalom* will not come---could not come---apart from his doing justice. And
his doing justice means crushing evil.

Second, it reminds me (again) that we Westerners, much though we have to offer
to our brothers and sisters around the world, also have much to learn from them.
The persecuted church is not so easily led astray in this area as we in our
comfort are. Likewise, we have much to learn from those who have gone before us.
Whatever their faults, many of our forebears in the faith got *this* right where
we get it wrong. We would do well to listen more humbly to our fellow saints of
every age and every tribe---and not to arrogate to ourselves the right to judge
God's justice.

Third, it reminds me to pray for God to work his justice in the world: to
deliver suffering saints in lands hostile to the gospel, and to end the
oppression of the wicked either by saving them from their sins or by ruining
them. This is not a comfortable prayer, but it is a good and right prayer. It
reminds me, too, to pray all the more fervently: "Lord, come soon!"
