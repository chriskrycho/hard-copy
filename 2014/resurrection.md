The resurrection exclaims that the present way of things is not final---that
cancer and depression and futility will someday pass away and be done with once
and for all. The broken world will be restored, every tear wiped away, every
sickness of body and mind healed, every sin defeated. It says this because the
resurrection is a historical reality, not merely a mystical hope. Jesus the son
of Mary was dead, and then he was no longer dead. His lungs---once pierced by a
spear, then deflated in death---breathed again. His heart beat again. He ate
again. He lived.
