> For as when a figure painted on wood has been soiled by dirt from
> outside, it is necessary for him whose figure it is to come again, so
> that the image can be renewed on the same material---because of his
> portrait even the material on which it is painted is not cast aside,
> but the portrait is reinscribed on it. In the same way the all-holy
> Son of the Father, being the Image of the Father, came to our place to
> renew the human being made according to himself, and to find him, as
> one lost, through the forgiveness, as himself says in the Gospels, "I
> came to seek and save the lost" (Lk 19.10).... So, rightly wishing to
> help human beings, he sojourned as a human being, taking to himself a
> body like theirs and from below---I mean through the works of the
> body---that those not wishing to know him from his providence and
> governance of the universe, from the works done through the body might
> know the Word of God in the body, and through him the Father....
>
> Now then, if they ask why he did not appear through other more noble
> parts of creation, or use some nobler instrument, as the sun or moon
> or stars or fire or air, but merely a human being, let them know that
> the Lord came not to be put on display but to heal and to teach those
> who were suffering. One being put on display only needs to appear and
> dazzle the beholders; but one who heals and teaches does not simply
> sojourn, but is of service to those in need and appears as those who
> need him can bear, lest by exceeding the need of those who suffer he
> trouble the very ones in need and the manifestation of the divine be
> of no benefit to them....
>
> Properly, therefore, the Word of God took a body and used a human
> instrument, in order to give life to the body and in order that, just
> as he is known in creation by his works, so also he might act in a
> human being, and show himself everywhere, leaving nothing barren of
> his divinity and knowledge. Again, I repeat, resuming what we said
> before, that the Savior did this in order that as he fills everything
> everywhere by his presence, so also he might fill all things with the
> knowledge of himself, as the divine scriptures say, 'The whole earth
> was filled with the knowledge of God' (Isa 11.9).
