> Doctrine is not merely an affair of the tongue, but of the life; is not
> apprehended by the intellect and memory merely, like other branches of
> learning; but is received only when it possesses the whole soul, and finds its
> seat and habitation in the inmost recesses of the heart.... To doctrine in
> which our religion is contained we have given the first place, since by it our
> salvation commences; but it must be transfused into the breast, and pass into
> the conduct, and so transform us into itself, as not to prove unfruitful.
