A few days ago, I heard someone make an interesting statement in a prayer:

> If we did not have a mission, you would just take us to be with you as soon as we were saved.

The sentiment was well-intentioned, to be sure, and it was driven by a passion for evangelism and missions, but I think it is wrong in certain important ways---ways which are symptomatic of deeper issues in evangelicalism, especially our understanding of human flourishing.
