Summary: Psalm 40 is a beautiful picture of rejoicing in God's salvation—and it is much sweeter set against the pleading of Psalm 39.

In addition to the devotional reading I have been recording here, I have been
working through large stretches of the Old Testament in my second Old Testament
survey class, which covers everything after Job in your English Bible---the
Psalms, the Wisdom literature, and all the Prophets. To cover all that ground in
a single semester requires moving quickly---so quickly that I both skip over
details  I might otherwise be attentive to, and pick up on overarching themes I
might otherwise miss. This is particularly evident in the Psalms, and having
just gone through them at a high pace makes the flow and the context of each
individual Psalm more apparent as I come to them for the details again in my
ordinary devotional reading. Reading large chunks and then coming back through
the same section more slowly is such a helpful practice that I expect I shall
try to keep it up.

Coming to Psalm 40, I am right in the middle of the Psalms of David---a whole
stretch focusing on[^attr] David's life and circumstances. Reading this
particular Psalm on its own is illuminating in its own ways, of course. It is
easy to come away with a sense of the joy of salvation from the exultant verses
here. The poem leaps from one triumphant note to another, rejoicing in how
Yahweh delivers his people and his anointed one. Hallelujah to that!

The Psalm's meaning is much, much richer when situated in the broader context of
the book, though. When we turn back a single song and look at Psalm 39, we see
that not every moment is so rosy and joyful. As I noted in my [last post](/2014
/with-confidence/), the prayer in Psalm 39 is bold and leans hard on God---
because David *needed* God profoundly. He needed salvation from his sins; he
recognized the brevity of his own life and especially its fragility before the
almighty maker of heaven and earth;[^rm] he knew that only Yahweh could
accomplish what he needed. The (Spirit-inspired!) editor of the Psalms took
these two poems on David's life and set them next to each other to teach us
something about the contours of a life devoted to Yahweh. Not every moment is
either sorrowful *or* rejoicing. More often, each one leads into the other as
the seasons of our life ebb and flow.

This ebb and flow is *good*. We see the beauty of our salvation the more clearly
because it is set against the backdrop of our great need for salvation. All too
often, we recognize that need only because we have been forced to by our
circumstances---by the travails of human life that range from parenting a
teething toddler to staring death full in its cancerous face (and we ought not
make little or too much of either, different scales though they be). We
sometimes find the joy of our salvation sweeter and more savory when we have
wrestled through the pain of loss and the wrestling with God that ensues. We
sometimes treasure God's answer more when has required us to wait for it---to
wait for *him*.

This is not to say that every trial is aimed at this end. It is to say that the
contrast between Psalms 39 and 40 helps us see that *sometimes* our trials work
out to deepen our joy in salvation. That in turn helps us hold on to God all the
more in the face of those trials, because it stands as one more picture of his
goodness and wisdom, and thus of his trustworthiness.

[^attr]: Whether written *by* or written *about*---the grammar in the headings
is a bit ambiguous; "of" here can mean "about" or "by".

[^rm]: Why, yes, that is a reference to the creed, and no, I can't think of
those words without hearing Rich Mullins sing them.
