The books of Chronicles serve as something of a parallel and supplementary
account to the books of 1 and 2 Samuel and 1 and 2 Kings.[^kings] There are a
few significant differences between the books, though. First, Samuel and Kings
take considerable time to trace out Saul's history and then divided their
attention fairly evenly between Judah and Israel, with a slight emphasis on
Israel because of Elijah and Elisha's ministries there. The Chronicles skip
almost entirely over Saul and focus predominantly on the Davidic line in Judah.

Second, Samuel and Kings generally let events speak for themselves, with little
commentary. Yahweh is always in control, but the author rarely provides explicit
theological interpretation of the events recorded. The Chronicles, rather
strikingly, *often* make straightforward claims about divine action and provide
moral commentary on the events they record. After its long list of
[genealogies](/theology/grappling-with-genealogies.html), 1 Chronicles turns to
a narrative of the history of the Hebrews in the kingdom era, picking up with
Saul's death---and immediately offers a theological interpretation of the events
(2 Samuel and 1 Kings simply report the events and a few people's responses):

> So Saul died for his breach of faith. he broke faith with the
> <span class=smcp>Lord</span> in that he did not keep the command of the
> <span class=smcp>Lord</span>, and also consulted a medium, seeking guidance.
> He did not seek guidance from the <span class=smcp>Lord</span>. Therefore the
> <span class=smcp>Lord</span> put him to death and turned the kingdom over to
> David the son of Jesse. (1 Chronicles 10:13--14, ESV)

No ambiguity, no reason to misunderstand what happened. Kings made it clear by
literary structure. The Chronicles just come out and say it: Yahweh took the
kingdom away from Saul because he was unfaithful to him, and he gave it to a man
who---whatever his faults, and they were indeed many---would follow Yahweh.

In Psalm 11, David evinces the very trust in Yahweh Saul lacked. He proclaims
his confidence that Yahweh will save him. To the warning that "the wicked bend
the bow; / they have fitted their arrow to the string / to shoot in the dark at
the upright in heart" (Psalm 11:2, ESV), David has a simple reply: "The <span
class=smcp>Lord</span> is in his holy temple; / the <span
class=smcp>Lord</span>'s throne is in heaven; his eyes
see, his eyelids test the children of man" (Psalm 11:4, ESV). David's confidence
was not in his own strength. His hope was not in being free and clear of anyone
who would oppose him, but in the one whose throne is in heaven. Saul spent his
days troubled and afraid because he was never secure in Yahweh.

Proverbs 11:28 (ESV) comments:

> | Whoever trusts in his riches will fall,  
> |     but the righteous will flourish like a green leaf.

The whole chapter resounds with the contrast between trust in riches or power or
mortal plans and righteousness. Righteousness, it seems, is in trusting and
obeying Yahweh. There is no righteousness that trusts in one's own strength.
There is only the righteousness "which comes through faith in Christ, the
righteousness from God that depends on faith" (Philippians 3:9, ESV). I am
reminded tonight not to trust in my own abilities, nor in the provision God has
given us,[^provision] but in God himself.

[^kings]: Originally these four books were a single book, just as 1 and 2
Chronicles were a single book; it is rather unfortunate the modern divisions
obscure this.

[^provision]: What folly to put our trust in the material things we have, when
they are not ours save by the generous gift of God!
