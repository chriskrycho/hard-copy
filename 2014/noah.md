I spent a good bit of time working on this over the last week, and I hope you'll
find it helpful.

> Last week saw the premiere of Darren Aronofsky's _Noah_, and with it a
> (predictable) storm of controversy from the evangelical community. Reviews
> have ranged from [predictably critical][mohler] to [outright disdain][patheos]
> to [hostile readings][mattson], and from [strongly (though not unreservedly)
> positive][ct] to [more restrained restrained affirmation][mccracken] of the
> film on [aesthetic and spiritual][relevant] grounds to especially measured
> [theological][sdg] and [artistic engagement][capc]. In short, the responses
> spanned exactly the range one would expect from the evangelical community,
> which is itself deeply divided on the purpose, value, and meaning of the
> arts---decades of conversation on the topic notwithstanding. _Noah_ works as a
> sort of theological-artistic Rorschach test. We seem to find it in what we
> expect given its origins and our disposition.

> Rather than offer another review (which would add nothing to the conversation
> at this point), or decry once again the predictable evangelical response to
> the arts, or even critique reviews with which I disagreed, I thought it might
> be useful instead to ask where we stand today and point to a few places we
> might grow from this.

I think you'll find [the rest of the piece][link] salient and helpful.
